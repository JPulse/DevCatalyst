I chose to do this website for the project because I personally find coding interesting and I wanted to present the class to the upcoming freshmen in a way that would get them as interested in the class as I was when and started and still am.

When I was designing this website, I wanted to make something simple that was also pleasing to the eyes as well. I got the blue and white colors because they work well together, and also the fact that they are our school colors.

When I started the design process I had a discussion with the teacher in charge of the class and got the design ideas from her.

During the building process of the website I only had a few minor errors that just needed a little help from google.

Home Page: The home page is designed to show off the class and its students, and to give a little information as to what goes on in the class.

The Info Tech, Web-Design, Website Dev, and Website Management pages are designed to give the students information about the class, it provides the class syllabus, it shows images of some of the projects the class participated in, and provides resources that the class uses.
