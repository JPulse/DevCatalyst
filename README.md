I chose to do this website for the project because I personaly find coding interesting and I wanted to present the class to the upcoming freshmen in a way that would get them as interested in the class as I was when and started and still am.

When I was desgining this website, I wanted to make something simple that was also pleasing to the eyes as well. I got the blue and white colors because they work well together, and also the fact that they are our school colors.
